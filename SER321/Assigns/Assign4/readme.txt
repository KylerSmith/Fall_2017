1) Start the server with the command.
	ant execute.java.server
2) Start the client with the command
	ant execute.java.client

You can start the server and run the shell scripts alone.
	By default they resort to executing on local host port 8080.

Rpi is not set up for external use. 
	Host and port is set for personal use.

PS.
	In the Assign4_pic.jpeg it says 'connecting to http://localhost:8080' but this is 
		just a print statement, I forgot to input the variables.

ISSUES
